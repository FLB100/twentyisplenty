# Here's a list of the 20 mods features in Twenty is Plenty, plus my personal reasoning for including them.

## 1 - [SKYUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)

**Description:**

*Elegant, PC-friendly interface mod with many advanced features.*

**Reasoning:**

You know it, you love it, its a must have. Could be considered a utility mod because of the MCM, but it drastically changes the UI, so I decided it counted as a full mod.

## 2 - [Dolomite Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7895)

**Description:**

*A lightweight weather overhaul designed like an ENB*

**Reasoning:**

A great change of pace from vanilla's dreary weathers. Also has decent ENB support, if you want to add an ENB to your install.

## 3 - [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614)

**Description:**

*Overhauls the third person gameplay similarly to modern action RPGs, entirely through SKSE. Move and attack in any direction. Includes a custom target lock component and an animated target reticle widget, target headtracking, projectile aim support during target lock, mount support and more! Modular and customizable through MCM.*

**Reasoning:**

Even though Twenty is Plenty wasn't designed for third person, TDM is still an essential.

## 4 - [Hammet's Dungeon Packs for SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186)

**Description:**

*Twenty Six (26) dungeons added to Skyrim and Solstheim to discover and explore plus a new world space called Desolate Veil, realm of Lord Vuldur*

**Reasoning:**

Great for exploration and high level content.

## 5 - [Enhanced textures detail (UV-tweaks)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/992)

**Description:**

*Enhances your existing textures without performance loss.*

**Reasoning:**

This list doesn't have any texture mods, so this just squeezes a bit more quality out of the vanilla textures.

## 6 - [Myrkvior - The Flora Of Skyrim - Trees SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28406)

**Description:**

*A new tree mod that includes grass, terrain and other options to create your ideal tree setup.*

**Reasoning:**

Good trees :)

## 7 - [The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272)

**Description:**

*The Great Cities is for anyone that wants to breath new life into or was unsatisfied with the minor cities and towns of Skyrim. This mod has lore friendliness in mind and builds upon the unique charateristics of each location. Each overhaul tries to make the areas look significantly different without altering the vanilla feel and gameplay too much.*

**Reasoning:**

Compliments Dawn of Skyrim, and adds more life to the places where you'll probably be spending a lot of your time.

## 8 - [Dawn of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9074)

**Description:**

*Dawn of Skyrim is a script-free overhaul of each of Skyrim five major cities (Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften, Solitude, and Markarth). It features new interior locations including temples, houses, and shops that are fully integrated into the radiant quest system (including the Thieves Guild quests). New NPCs sell new lore-friendly items and have detailed schedules.*

**Reasoning:**

Overhauls the important cities and gives them some new life. I prefer this to JK's

## 9 - [Open World Loot - Encounter Zone and Loot Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)

**Description:**

*The goal of OWL is to provide an OPEN WORLD and immersive experience, let the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration.*

**Reasoning:**

Balances out Skyrim and encourages risk taking.

## 10 - [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)

**Description:**

*Ever worried about accidentally advancing the wrong skill that contributed to your level? You don't have to anymore. Now you can gain levels by completing quests and exploring. Skills don't give experience but they are capped relatively to player's level for balancing reasons (see skill caps section below). Feel free to train Lockpicking without actually gimping yourself!*

**Reasoning:**

Encourages exploration and quest-taking. Improves upon Beth's (in my opinion, awful) use-to-level system.

## 11 - [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704)

**Description:**

*Skyrim's quests tends to force you into them, especially the main quest. If you use the vanilla start there is no reasonable place to stop and go and do something else, despite the game being go anywhere do anything. Alternate Start helps, but you tend to run out of reasons to avoid Helgen.  There is always a Dragon to fight, a quest to do, never time to steal every sweetroll in Skyrim. And no matter what character you are playing, you are always expected to be a hero, in a game with three evil questlines. So this mod should hopefully fix this, by giving the player breaks at various stages.*

**Reasoning:**

Sure the world is ending but I want to fish, leave me alone delphine! Improves pacing.

## 12 - [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272)

**Description:**

*Live Another Life provides an alternative means to start the game for those who do not wish to go through the lengthy intro sequence at Helgen. You will be given the opportunity to choose your race and then choose a new life for your character to lead. A wide variety of choices will be available. What you choose will have a lasting impact, so choose carefully or the gods may forsake you again!*

**Reasoning:**

Simpler than Alternate Perspective, with a similar amount of choice.

## 13 - [Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549)

**Description:**

*Blade and Blunt is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s combat designed to increase the game’s difficulty and encourage active resource management. Unlike other combat overhauls, it does not seek to import mechanics from other games into Skyrim. Instead, it enhances the existing mechanics of Skyrim’s combat and focuses on tightening the gameplay to allow for more player skill and RPG-like character development.*

**Reasoning:**

It's the one I'm used to lmao.

## 14 - [Armor Variants Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34100)

**Description:**

*Armor Variants Expansion aims to adjust and increase variety of armors in Skyrim, by adding new variants of vanilla armors to the leveled lists trying to be extremely lore friendly. This does not replace models, rather than enhancing variety of the armors found in Skyrim.*

**Reasoning:**

Lore friendly and doesn't take away from the creation club armors or other mods in this list.

## 15 - [Reforging - To the Masses (Weapons Expansion)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49030)

**Description:**

*Reforging - To the Masses adds around 300 vanilla-friendly melee weapons to the game. Including daggers, axes, maces, swords, battleaxes, which can be found, taken from opponents (almost everything in the level lists), and also forged if you have the appropriate blacksmithing skills, or when certain conditions and quests are fulfilled * (see below).*

**Reasoning:**

Improves weapon variety and keeps things believable.

## 16 - [Interesting NPCs SE (3DNPC)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)

**Description:**

*Interesting NPCs is a project to add color and life to Skyrim through three-dimensional characters. Each NPC is integrated into the world, with a backstory and an extensive dialogue tree to explore. Many of these characters are fully voiced by a talented team of over 80 voice actors. The dialogue choices allow you to role-play, providing humor and depth to each conversation. You can be a jerk or a jester, a white knight or an assassin, as the most important character is you.*

**Reasoning:**

I was conflicted about adding this because of some of the voice acting, but it adds a lot of content so it made the cut.

## 17 - [INIGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461)

**Description:**

*Inigo is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in archery, one-handed, and sneak.*

**Reasoning:**

He's cannon at this point.

## 18 - [Nordic Faces - Immersive Characters Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40658)

**Description:**

*Lore-friendly texture and FaceGen for player and all the NPCs.*

**Reasoning:**

Pretty much the best vanilla+ NPC overhaul.

## 19 - [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)

**Description:**

*Lucien is a fully voiced Imperial follower with over 5000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.*

**Reasoning:**

Inigo's best friend :)

## 20 - [Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)

**Description:**

*Ordinator overhauls the perk trees of Skyrim to increase the depth and fun of character building. It is highly compatible with other mods and uses lightweight and clean scripting.*

**Reasoning:**

An insane amount of perk options, perfect for maximising replayability.
